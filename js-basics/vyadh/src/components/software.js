            With a team of 11 skilled members, our Software Domain is a powerhouse of innovation. Within this domain, we specialize in two key sub-domainsâ€”ground Control Station (GCS) and Autonomous Systems. GCS is the communication hub, establishing a seamless link with the rover and taking charge of control. The Autonomous team pioneers the realm of self-sufficiency, ensuring the rover executes tasks autonomously, making intelligent decisions without human intervention. Our software experts drive the technological backbone, orchestrating a symphony of precision and autonomy
